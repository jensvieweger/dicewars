# dicewars
A Clone of the famous Dice-Wars game written in Rust

## Milestones

As for me, this project is to come into touch with Rust, there will be several milestones as I grasp the details of Rust:

1. Write a basic version of Dicewars
  1. Hot-seat mode
  2. Only square or possibly hexagon shaped fields (not the "countries" mad up of several hexagon shaped fields as the original Dicewars has).
  3. User Interface via console only

2. Extending towards original Dicewars
  1. Support for hexagon shaped fields and "countries" made up of several hexagon shaped fields. 
  2. Basic AI

3. Wishful thinking
  1. Refactor code to have several libs, the game-framework itself (support other 2D map based game types as well; think of Sudoku,...), the lib of the specific game, an AI lib and a graphics lib
  2. Add advanced AI (with learning and stuff)
  3. Add other graphic outputs.

## Contributing

As this is my first Rust project, feel free to point out things i've written not as smart, short & nice looking as Rust would offer.
